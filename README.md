# Athan Clock 🕌

An automated Islamic prayer time application for Linux systems that fetches prayer times from the internet and plays Athan (call to prayer) at the correct times throughout the day.

## Features

- 🌍 Automatically fetches prayer times based on your location
- 🔔 Plays Athan audio files at each prayer time
- 🎵 Different Athan recordings for Fajr and other prayers
- 🔄 Auto-updates prayer times daily
- 🗣️ Voice announcements using text-to-speech
- 🚀 Easy setup with automated dependency installation
- 🔧 Background service management (start, stop, restart)
- 🌅 Optional auto-start on system boot
- 📊 Built-in logging and status checking

## Prerequisites

This application is designed for **Linux systems** (tested on Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, including Raspberry Pi).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MushfiqShovon/AthanClock.git
   cd AthanClock
   ```

2. **Make the setup script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x RunAthan.sh
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and set up the application:**
   ```bash
   ./RunAthan.sh install
   ```

   Or for a complete setup (install + start + enable startup):
   ```bash
   ./RunAthan.sh
   ```

The setup will automatically:
- Check for required packages (`python3`, `espeak`, `mpg123`)
- Install any missing dependencies
- Start the application in background
- Enable auto-start on system boot

## Configuration

Before running, you may want to customize the settings in `prayer_clock.py`:

```python
# ========= CONFIG =========
CITY = "Morgantown"           # Your city name
COUNTRY = "USA"               # Your country
METHOD = 2                    # Calculation method (see below)
PLAYER = "mpg123 -a hw:0,0"   # Audio player command
# ==========================
```

### Calculation Methods

The `METHOD` parameter determines which calculation method to use for prayer times:

- `1` - University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi
- `2` - Muslim World League (default)
- `3` - Egyptian General Authority of Survey
- `4` - Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah
- `5` - Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)

For more methods, visit: [Aladhan API Documentation](http://api.aladhan.com/v1/methods)

## Audio Files

The application requires the following audio files in the project directory:

- `athan_fajr.mp3` - For Fajr prayer
- `athan_durd.mp3` - For Dhuhr, Asr, and Maghrib prayers
- `athan_esha.mp3` - For Isha prayer

**Note:** These audio files are included in the repository.

## Usage

The `RunAthan.sh` script provides easy management of the Athan Clock service:

### Available Commands

```bash
./RunAthan.sh [command]
```

**Commands:**

- `install` - Install required dependencies only
- `start` - Start Athan Clock in background
- `stop` - Stop the running Athan Clock
- `restart` - Restart Athan Clock
- `status` - Check if Athan Clock is running
- `enable-startup` - Enable auto-start on system boot
- `disable-startup` - Remove from system startup
- `logs` - View the last 50 lines of application logs
- *(no command)* - Complete setup: install + start + enable startup

### Common Usage Examples

**First time setup:**
```bash
./RunAthan.sh install             # Install dependencies
./RunAthan.sh start               # Start the application
./RunAthan.sh enable-startup      # Enable auto-start on boot
```

**Quick setup (all-in-one):**
```bash
./RunAthan.sh
```

**Daily management:**
```bash
./RunAthan.sh status     # Check if running
./RunAthan.sh stop       # Stop the application
./RunAthan.sh start      # Start the application
./RunAthan.sh restart    # Restart the application
./RunAthan.sh logs       # View recent logs
```

**Disable auto-start:**
```bash
./RunAthan.sh disable-startup
```

### Manual Start (Advanced)
If you prefer to run directly without the management script:
```bash
python3 prayer_clock.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetches Prayer Times**: Uses the [Aladhan API](http://api.aladhan.com) to get daily prayer times based on your location
2. **Calculates Wait Time**: Determines how long to wait until the next prayer
3. **Plays Athan**: At each prayer time, plays the appropriate audio file
4. **Daily Reset**: Automatically fetches new times at midnight for the next day
5. **Background Service**: Runs as a daemon process, continuing even after terminal closes
6. **Auto-start**: Optionally configured via crontab to start on system boot

### Service Management

- **PID File**: `.athan_clock.pid` - Stores the process ID for tracking
- **Log File**: `athan_clock.log` - Contains all application output and errors
- **Status Tracking**: The script monitors the process and prevents duplicate instances

## Troubleshooting

### Check Application Status
```bash
./RunAthan.sh status
./RunAthan.sh logs
```

### No Sound Output
- Check audio device configuration in `PLAYER` variable
- Test with: `mpg123 athan_fajr.mp3`
- For different audio output, modify: `mpg123 -a hw:X,Y` (find devices with `aplay -l`)
- Check logs: `./RunAthan.sh logs`

### Cannot Fetch Prayer Times
- Check internet connection
- Verify city/country names are correct in `prayer_clock.py`
- The application will retry every 2 minutes if fetching fails
- View errors with: `./RunAthan.sh logs`

### Application Won't Start
- Check if already running: `./RunAthan.sh status`
- Stop and restart: `./RunAthan.sh restart`
- Check for errors: `./RunAthan.sh logs`

### Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x RunAthan.sh
chmod +x prayer_clock.py
```

### Remove from Startup
If you no longer want the application to start automatically:
```bash
./RunAthan.sh disable-startup
```

### Completely Stop the Application
```bash
./RunAthan.sh stop
./RunAthan.sh disable-startup
```
